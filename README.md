# cpp-Library
A C++ library with all the online array problems and etc which I get online.

# Setup
To setup it simply just download the repo and then move all the files in ```src/``` directory to the in the Mingw folder  for example ```C:\Mingw\mingw64\lib\gcc\x86_64-w64-mingw32\8.1.0\include\c++``` and then move or copy the files in that directory and then it will be globally enabled or else you can put the files in the directory of the file.

# Functions
I will add README.md for it very soon.

# Contribute
If you want to contribute then open a PR or an issue on this repo.
